Born in Calgary, Alberta, Jeff Cave discovered a passion for business data 
analysis in his teens. This passion blossomed into a career as a professional 
software developer and business analyst. 

More than just developing software, Jeff loves to share the hidden beauty of 
data with young developers and clients alike; and appreciates those who love 
to share their art regardless of what that art is.

Having tried his hand at recreational beekeeping and firefighting, Jeff can 
often be found gathering samples of Halifax fish populations in his spare time 
(aka: fishing)
